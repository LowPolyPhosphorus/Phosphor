# Phosphor
A mini PC gaming console setup that transforms an AZW Green G3 into a fully controller navigated entertainment system. It uses an Xbox controller for desktop navigation (using jstest-gtk & AntiMicroX), EmulationStation-DE frontend for unified game library management (Steam + emulators), and optimized for couch gaming on a TV. Runs on Zorin OS with custom controller mappings for seamless navigation without a keyboard/mouse.
